    "description": "Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a cryptocurrency that shares many of the same characteristics as Bitcoin (BTC) yet also integrates a number of changes and features that set it apart. It is considered a 'fork' of Bitcoin, although proponents argue that Bitcoin Cash more closely adheres to the original vision of creating a peer-to-peer electronic cash system as laid out in a 2008 white paper written by the founder of the protocol, a person or group going by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. This is a token bridged by BenSwap from BNB Smart Chain (BSC).",
