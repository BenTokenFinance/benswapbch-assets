    "description": "RBT2023 is a zodiac token to celebrate and commemorate the Lunar Festival of the year 2023. It has a fixed supply of 55k tokens. 25k tokens are sold in an IBO for EBEN at 1:1 rate and then add liquidity with another 25k. The rest 5k is produced in a ranch which lasts for about 15 weeks. It has a price protection mechanism. Once its price drops below the IBO price (1 EBEN), it will be bought back, so that its price has a guaranteed bottom.",
